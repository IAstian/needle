Do you need to moderate the content in your website, Especially what the User enters, Example in a contact form?

Well, You can create an array with example the words you dont want the user to write

Then add a foreach loop. Then now use the'as' varable to check for the words And an auto Incrimenting variable to number the array values(not from Zero)
